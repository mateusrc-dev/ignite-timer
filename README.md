# ‚û°Ô∏è Ignite Timer project created in TypeScript and ReactJs

‚û°Ô∏è This application consists of a timer in which we can play, we can write the activity we are going to carry out, and when we stop the timer, that activity and recorded time will be recorded in the history

‚û°Ô∏è Javascript logic was created to create the timer (for the time to return) - the setInterval function was used to count the seconds

‚û°Ô∏è In this project, technologies such as ReactJs, Context Api, useState, useReduce, as well as JavaScript (repeating structures, if and else) were used.

### Some techniques that were used in this project are:

- Immutability of state
- Lists and keys in ReactJs
- Componentization
- Properties

### üíª To run the application on your machine download the repository and in the repository terminal run the command 'npm run dev' to run vite
